                <a class="title-link" href="#why">
                    <h2 class="title">Why</h2>
                </a>
                <p>
                    I just wanted to commission someone to create some dumb art on Twitter ‚Äî the
                    upshot is I had to wade through a load of bots (as expected), but also some
                    really shitly marketed <i>legit accounts</i>. That's maaaaad!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't worry, I'm the furthest you can possibly be from a "marketing sort" of
                    person, but from my own experience of running a small business I can appreciate
                    the need to grasp every opportunity to get work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting in front of people is only the start ‚Äî once you're there, you need to
                    <i>sell yourself</i>
                    <s>preferably without selling your soul like those marketing executives</s>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So here's some really simple pointers ‚Äî so simple, it's
                    <strong>barely marketing</strong>.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="website">
                <a class="title-link" href="#website">
                    <h2 class="title">Have a damn website</h2>
                </a>
                <p>
                    Bruh, it's 2022, everyone has a fucking website ‚Äî if you don't, you're telling
                    me you're either <i>brand new</i> or out to scam people (and thus don't want to
                    be tied to anything).
                </p>
                <h3>How?</h3>
                <p>
                    Maybe you're put off because you're not a nerd who knows HTML? Like, I barely
                    know this shit, I promise <i>you'll learn it easily</i>, but if you're pressed
                    for time just set up a
                    <a href="https://www.wix.com" target="_blank">wix.com site</a> or something...
                    there are <i>so many</i> free website hosts with easy to use page builders, so
                    you really don't üëè have üëè an üëè excuse üëè okay?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'd also suggest setting up a
                    <a href="https://linktr.ee" target="_blank">linktr.ee</a> (or similar) so you
                    can centralise all your profile links and stuff. Clever shit.
                </p>
                <h3>What do I put on my website?</h3>
                <p>
                    Depends on what you do, innit? I'd expect an artist to primarily have a
                    portfolio of their art, a composer to have demos of their music etc. ‚Äî you're
                    showing off what you can do, and the quality of your work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've finished bragging about your furry art skills, make sure you have a
                    way to contact you prominently displayed ‚Äî the average attention span does
                    <i>not</i> lend itself to looking for an email address three pages deep.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="authentic">
                <a class="title-link" href="#authentic">
                    <h2 class="title">Be authentic</h2>
                </a>
                <p>
                    The example I'm thinking of here is the extreme sketchiness of a Twitter artist
                    with 4000 followers but 7 tweets (and <i>they're</i> all retweets of similar
                    accounts...) ‚Äî don't do that, you sketchy fuck.
                </p>
                <h3>How?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you're into your social media, interact with people! I know, I know... I hate
                    people too, but its good for business. I want to know I'm not talking to a bot
                    or a scammer with 100 accounts, so tweet about your day, or about that new
                    graphics tablet you bought.
                </p>
                <p>And yes, retweet all that horrific furry art.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="easy">
                <a class="title-link" href="#easy">
                    <h2 class="title">Make it easy</h2>
                </a>
                <p>
                    You've got wares, and they have coin ‚Äî so for everyone's sake, make it really
                    <i>really</i> feckin' easy for people to buy your shit.
                </p>
                <h3>How?</h3>
                <p>
                    I mentioned it above, but I'll do so again ‚Äî I can't buy that awesome fursona if
                    I can't contact you, and fuck knows I've got better things to be doing than
                    looking for an email address, so make that very prominent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Are you using a platform which has built-in e-commerce? Based ‚Äî so use it, and
                    make sure all your orders go through that. If you're not, maybe consider setting
                    up a
                    <a href="https://more.ko-fi.com/shop" target="_blank">shop on ko-fi.com</a>?
                    Being able to pay for things using PayPal or whatnot speeds up the process for
                    everyone (and gives buyers a sense of security).
